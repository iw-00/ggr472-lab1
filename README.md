Creating a GeoJSON and HTML webpage.

## Description

The GeoJSON contains stargazing sites in Ontario, adapted from https://www.destinationontario.com/en-ca/articles/best-places-for-stargazing-ontario using geojson.io.

The webpage contains a link to the external website, as well as to the GeoJSON file. There is also a page for trivia and a separate script for its functionality.
