Creating a GeoJSON and HTML webpage.

## Description

The GeoJSON contains stargazing sites in Ontario, adapted from https://www.destinationontario.com/en-ca/articles/best-places-for-stargazing-ontario using geojson.io.

The Home page contains a link to the original external website, as well as to the GeoJSON file. 

The Trivia page contains a trivia question and links to Wikipedia for more information on the trivia responses. A separate script is used for the Trivia page's functionality.
